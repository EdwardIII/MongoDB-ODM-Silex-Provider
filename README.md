# MongoDB ODM Silex Service Provider

This [Silex](silex.sensiolabs.org/) service provider provides Doctrine
[MongoDB ODM](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/latest/index.html)
service in your Silex Application.

This provider has been developed by [Justin Hileman](https://github.com/bobthecow/SilexExtensions/tree/master/DoctrineMongoDB/src)
and [Florian Klein](https://github.com/docteurklein/SilexServiceProviders/tree/master/DoctrineMongoDB/src)

It seems that both of these projects are not maintained anymore, so here comes
the maintained version, compatible with Doctrine MongoDB ODM >= 1.0.0-beta4.

Enjoy
